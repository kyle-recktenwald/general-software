# Algorithm Overview:
* An algorithm is a **step-by-step procedure** or **set of rules used** to **solve a specific problem** or **perform a 
  particular task**
* It's essentially a **sequence** of **well-defined instructions** designed to be **executed in a specific order** to 
  achieve a **desired outcome**
* Algorithms are used extensively in computer science, mathematics, and various fields to automate processes, make 
  decisions, and solve problems efficiently
* **In Place Algorithm:**
  * In computer science, an **in-place algorithm** is an algorithm that **operates directly on the input data 
    structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size**
  * In other words, it **modifies the input in place**, **without creating a separate copy** of the data structure
  * An algorithm which is **not in-place** is sometimes called **not-in-place** or **out-of-place**
