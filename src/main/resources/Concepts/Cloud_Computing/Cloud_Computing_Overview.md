# Cloud Computing Overview:

### Overview:
* **Cloud computing** refers to the **delivery** of **computing services**—such as **servers**, **storage**, 
  **databases**, **networking**, **software**, and **more**—**over the internet ("the cloud")**
* Instead of **owning and maintaining physical hardware or infrastructure**, **users and organizations** can **access 
  these services on-demand** from a **cloud service provider**
* Key characteristics of cloud computing include:
  * **On-Demand Service:**
    * Users can **access computing resources instantly** and **as needed**, **paying only for what they use**, similar 
      to **utility services** like **electricity or water**
  * **Scalability:**
    * Cloud services can be **easily scaled up or down based on demand**
    * This **flexibility** allows users to **adjust resources** to **handle varying workloads**
  * **Resource Pooling:**
    * Cloud providers **pool resources** to **serve multiple customers**, allowing for **greater efficiency and cost 
      savings**
    * **Resources** are **dynamically assigned and reassigned as needed**
  * **Self-Service:**
    * Users can p**rovision and manage resources** through **self-service portals or APIs without direct interaction 
      with the service provider**
  * **Elasticity:**
    * Cloud services can **automatically scale resources** to **accommodate workload changes**
    * For instance, **additional servers** can be **provisioned during peak traffic periods** and **deprovisioned during 
      low-demand times**
  * **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:**
    * Users are **billed based on their actual usage**, avoiding **large upfront investments in infrastructure**
    * This **pay-as-you-go model** offers **cost-effectiveness** and **budget flexibility**
* Cloud computing offers different **service models**:
  * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
    * Provides **virtualized computing resources over the internet**
    * Users can **rent virtual machines**, **storage**, and **networking resources**
  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
    * Offers a **platform** allowing users to **develop**, **run**, and **manage applications without dealing with the 
      underlying infrastructure**
    * It includes **development tools**, **databases**, and **middleware**
  * **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
    * **Delivers software applications** over the internet
    * Users **access applications hosted by the provider** on a **subscription basis**, **eliminating the need for 
      installation and maintenance**
* Cloud computing has **revolutionized** the way **businesses and individuals access and utilize computing resources**
* It enables **agility**, **cost-efficiency**, **scalability**, and **accessibility** to a **wide range of powerful 
  computing services**, **empowering innovation and growth** across **various industries**

### Kubernetes:
* **Kubernetes**, often abbreviated as **K8s** (since there are **8 characters between the 'K' and the 's'**), is an 
  **open-source container orchestration platform**
* Developed by **Google** and now **maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**, Kubernetes 
  **simplifies** the **deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of **containerized applications**
* Key components and concepts within Kubernetes include:
  * **Containers:**
    * Kubernetes **manages** and **orchestrates containers**
    * **Containers package an application** and **its dependencies**, **ensuring consistency across various 
      environments**
  * **Cluster:**
    * A **Kubernetes cluster** consists of **multiple nodes** (**servers**) that **run containerized applications**
    * **Each cluster** contains a **control plane** and **worker nodes**
  * **Master Node (Control Plane):**
    * This is the **brain of the Kubernetes cluster**, **managing and coordinating** the **cluster's components**
    * It includes **various components** like the **API server**, **scheduler**, **controller manager**, and **etcd** 
      (a **distributed key-value store for cluster data**)
  * **Worker Node:**
    * These are the **machines** that **run the actual containerized applications**
    * They **host multiple pods** (**groups of containers**), **managed by the Kubernetes components running on the 
      master node**
  * **Pod:**
    * The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes, a **pod encapsulates one or more containers** with **shared 
      storage and networking**
    * **Containers within a pod share the same IP address** and **can communicate with each other using localhost**
  * **Deployment:**
    * Kubernetes allows you to **define a desired state for your applications** using **YAML or JSON configuration 
      files**
    * **Deployments** enable you to **describe and manage how your applications should run**, including the **number of 
      replicas** and **how they should be updated**
  * **Service:**
    * A **Kubernetes service** provides a **stable endpoint** (**IP address**) to **access a group of pods**
    * **Services abstract away the complexity** of **individual pod IPs** and **manage load balancing across multiple 
      pods**
  * **Namespace:**
    * **Namespaces** provide a way to **logically divide cluster resources** into **multiple virtual clusters**
    * They help **organize** and **isolate applications and resources**
* Kubernetes **streamlines container orchestration**, enabling **efficient resource utilization**, **scalability**, 
  **resilience**, and **automation** of **various tasks associated** with **deploying and managing containerized 
  applications**
* It's a **widely adopted platform** in the world of **cloud-native application development and deployment**

### Containers:
* **Containers** in software refer to a **lightweight**, **portable**, and **self-sufficient package** that **includes 
  everything needed to run an application**: **code**, **runtime**, **system tools**, **libraries**, and **settings**
* They **encapsulate an application and its dependencies**, allowing it to **run reliably across different computing 
  environments**, **from development to testing and production**
* Key attributes of containers include:
  * **Isolation:**
    * Containers provide a **level of isolation**, allowing **applications** to **run independently without interfering 
      with other applications or the underlying host system**
    * This isolation is achieved through **containerization technologies** like **Docker**, **containerd**, or **cri-o**
  * **Portability:**
    * Containers are **highly portable across different operating systems**, **cloud environments**, and **platforms**, 
      as they **encapsulate all dependencies within a single package**
  * **Efficiency:**
    * They are **lightweight** and **share the host system's kernel**, leading to **efficient resource utilization** and
      **faster startup times** compared to **traditional virtual machines**
  * **Consistency:**
    * Containers ensure **consistent behavior** of applications **across various environments**, reducing the **"works 
      on my machine" problem** often encountered in software development
  * **Scalability:**
    * Containerized applications can be **easily scaled up or down** to **meet changing demands** by **launching 
      multiple instances (replicas)** of the **same container**
* Containerization technologies, like **Docker**, rely on **features of the host operating system**, such as 
  **namespaces** and **control groups (cgroups)**, to **provide isolation and resource management** for containers
* These technologies use **container images**, which contain the **application code**, its **dependencies**, and 
  **runtime environment configurations**
* Containers have become **integral to modern software development and deployment practices**, especially in 
  **cloud-native architectures and DevOps workflows**, enabling **agility**, **consistency**, and **efficiency** in 
  **building**, **deploying**, and **managing applications** across **diverse environments**
