# Network Overview:

### Overview:
* In software, a **network** typically refers to a **group** of **interconnected computers or devices** that can 
  **communicate** and **share resources**
* There are **different types of networks**, and they can be **defined** and **implemented** using **various software 
  components**
* Here are some key elements involved in defining a network in software:
  * **Network Operating System (NOS):**
    * A **network operating system** is **software** that **provides the functionality** of **managing and coordinating 
      network resources**
    * Examples include **Microsoft Windows Server**, **Linux-based systems** with **networking capabilities**, and 
      **Novell NetWare**
  * **Network Protocols:**
    * **Protocols** are **rules** or **standards** that **define how data is transmitted over a network**
    * Common protocols include **TCP/IP** (**Transmission Control Protocol**/**Internet Protocol**), **UDP** (**User 
      Datagram Protocol**), **HTTP** (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**), and others
    * These protocols **enable communication between devices on the network**
  * **Network Configuration Software:**
    * **Tools** and **utilities** are available to **configure and manage network settings**
    * This includes **assigning IP addresses**, **configuring DNS (Domain Name System)**, setting up **routing tables**, 
      and **managing network security settings**
    * Examples include the **Network and Sharing Center in Windows** or **command-line tools in Linux**
  * **Network Services:**
    * **Various services run on a network** to **provide specific functions**
    * Examples include **DHCP** (**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**) for **automatically assigning IP addresses**, 
      **DNS** for **translating domain names to IP addresses**, and **file sharing services** like **SMB (Server Message 
      Block)**
  * **Firewall Software:**
    * To **secure a network**, **firewall software** is used to **monitor and control incoming and outgoing network 
      traffic** based on **predetermined security rules**
    * This helps **protect against unauthorized access** and **potential security threats**
  * **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Software:**
    * **VPN software** enables **secure communication** over a **public network**, such as the **internet**
    * It creates a **private, encrypted connection between devices**, **allowing users to access resources on the 
      network securely**
  * **Monitoring and Management Tools:**
    * Software tools for **monitoring network performance**, **identifying issues**, and **managing network resources** 
      are crucial
    * **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** is **one example** of a **protocol used for network management**
  * **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):**
    * **SDN** is an **approach to network management** that **allows network administrators** to **control and manage 
      the network** through **software applications**
    * It **abstracts the underlying hardware** and **enables programmability** and **automation** of **network tasks**
* By **configuring** and **utilizing** these **software components**, **network administrators** can **define and manage 
  the behavior**, **communication**, and **security** of a **computer network**
* The **specific tools and technologies** used **may vary depending** on the **type** and **scale** of the network

### IP Address:
* An **IP address**, short for **Internet Protocol address**, is a **numerical label assigned to each device connected 
  to a computer network** that **uses the Internet Protocol for communication**
* IP addresses serve **two main purposes**:
  * **Host or Network Identification:**
    * IP addresses **uniquely identify devices**, such as **computers**, **servers**, **routers**, and **other networked 
      devices**, on a **TCP/IP** (**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**) **network**
    * They enable devices to **locate and communicate with each other over the Internet** or **any other IP-based 
      network**
  * **Location Addressing:**
    * IP addresses are used for **routing data packets between devices in a network**
    * They **help routers and switches determine the destination of a packet** and **forward it to the appropriate 
      device**
* IP addresses come in **two versions**:
  * **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**
    * This is the **most widely used version** and consists of a **32-bit numerical label** written as **four octets 
      separated by periods** (e.g., **192.168.0.1**)
    * **IPv4 addresses have become scarce** due to the **growth of the internet**, and **Network Address Translation 
      (NAT)** is **commonly used** to **share a single public IPv4 address among multiple devices** within a **private 
      network**
  * **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**
    * **IPv6** was introduced to **address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses** and provides a **much larger address 
      space**
    * It uses a **128-bit numerical label** and is represented in **hexadecimal format** (e.g., 
      **2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334**)
    * **IPv6 adoption** is **increasing** to **accommodate the growing number of connected devices**
* IP addresses can be categorized into **two main types**:
  * **Public IP Address:**
    * **Public IP addresses** are **globally unique** and **routable on the public internet**
    * They are **assigned** by **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** to **devices** that **need to be directly 
      accessible from the internet**
  * **Private IP Address:**
    * **Private IP addresses** are **used within private networks** and are **not directly accessible from the 
      internet**
    * Devices **within a private network share a common private IP address space**, and **Network Address Translation 
      (NAT)** is used to **map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address** for **internet 
      communication**
* In summary, an IP address is a **fundamental element** in **computer networking**, enabling **communication** and 
  **identification** of **devices in a networked environment**
