# Network Overview: - TODO

### Overview:
* In software, a **network** typically refers to a **group** of **interconnected computers or devices** that can 
  **communicate** and **share resources**
* There are **different types of networks**, and they can be **defined** and **implemented** using **various software 
  components**
* Here are some key elements involved in defining a network in software:
  * **Network Operating System (NOS):**
    * A **network operating system** is **software** that **provides the functionality** of **managing and coordinating 
      network resources**
    * Examples include **Microsoft Windows Server**, **Linux-based systems** with **networking capabilities**, and 
      **Novell NetWare**
  * **Network Protocols:**
    * **Protocols** are **rules** or **standards** that **define how data is transmitted over a network**
    * Common protocols include **TCP/IP** (**Transmission Control Protocol**/**Internet Protocol**), **UDP** (**User 
      Datagram Protocol**), **HTTP** (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**), and others
    * These protocols **enable communication between devices on the network**
  * **Network Configuration Software:**
    * Tools and utilities are available to configure and manage network settings
    * This includes assigning IP addresses, configuring DNS (Domain Name System), setting up routing tables, and 
      managing network security settings
    * Examples include the Network and Sharing Center in Windows or command-line tools in Linux
  * **Network Services:**
    * Various services run on a network to provide specific functions
    * Examples include DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for automatically assigning IP addresses, DNS for 
      translating domain names to IP addresses, and file sharing services like SMB (Server Message Block)
  * **Firewall Software:**
    * To secure a network, firewall software is used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic 
      based on predetermined security rules
    * This helps protect against unauthorized access and potential security threats
  * **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Software:**
    * VPN software enables secure communication over a public network, such as the internet
    * It creates a private, encrypted connection between devices, allowing users to access resources on the network 
      securely
  * **Monitoring and Management Tools:**
    * Software tools for monitoring network performance, identifying issues, and managing network resources are crucial
    * SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is one example of a protocol used for network management
  * **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):**
    * SDN is an approach to network management that allows network administrators to control and manage the network 
      through software applications
    * It abstracts the underlying hardware and enables programmability and automation of network tasks
* By configuring and utilizing these software components, network administrators can define and manage the behavior, 
  communication, and security of a computer network
* The specific tools and technologies used may vary depending on the type and scale of the network
