# Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery Overview:

### Overview:
* **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)** are practices in software development that aim to 
  **streamline the process of building, testing, and delivering software**
* They are often used together and are sometimes referred to as CI/CD
* **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  * **Continuous Integration** is a software development practice in which **code changes** are **frequently integrated** 
    into a **shared repository**, such as a **version control system** (e.g., **Git**), and **automatically built and 
    tested**
  * The main goals of CI are:
    * **Frequent Integration:**
      * Developers **frequently merge their code changes** into a **central repository** to ensure that **all code 
        changes** are continuously integrated
    * **Automated Builds:**
      * The CI system **automatically compiles the code**, ensuring that it can be built successfully
    * **Automated Testing:**
      * Automated tests, such as **unit tests** and **integration tests**, are run to verify that the newly integrated 
        code **doesn't introduce defects** or **break existing functionality**
    * **Early Detection of Issues:**
      * CI **helps identify issues, bugs, and integration conflicts early in the development process**, making it 
        **easier to fix them**
    * **Reduced Integration Pain:**
      * By integrating code frequently, the process of **merging multiple changes** is **less painful and error-prone**
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  * **Continuous Delivery** is an **extension of CI** and is a practice that **ensures that your software can be 
    released to production at any time**
  * It focuses on automating the deployment and delivery processes
  * The main goals of CD are:
    * **Automated Deployment:**
      * CD ensures that the **entire deployment process** is **automated** and can be **triggered at any time**
      * This includes tasks like **packaging the application**, **configuring the environment**, and **deploying it to 
        production**
    * **Consistent Environments:**
      * CD ensures that the **development, testing, and production environments** are **as consistent as possible** to 
        **reduce deployment-related issues**
    * **One-Click Deployments:**
      * The goal is to make it **easy to deploy** a **new version** of the software with **minimal manual intervention**
      * Ideally, this can be done with a **single click or command**
    * **Rollback Capabilities:**
      * CD also includes the ability to **roll back to a previous version** if **issues are detected after a 
        deployment**
* Together, CI/CD helps development teams automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and delivering 
  software
* This leads to more reliable, stable, and faster software development and release cycles, ultimately improving the 
  software development and deployment pipeline

### CI/CD Tools and Technologies:
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines can be implemented using a wide range of tools and 
  technologies, depending on your specific requirements and preferences
  * **Continuous Integration Tools:**
    * **Jenkins:**
      * Jenkins is one of the most popular open-source CI/CD automation servers
      * It offers a wide range of plugins and integrations with other tools
  * **Continuous Delivery Tools:**
    * * **Ansible:**
      * An automation tool that can be used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation
    * **Docker:**
      * Docker containers are commonly used to package applications and their dependencies, making it easier to ensure 
        consistency between development, testing, and production environments
    * **Kubernetes:**
      * Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that can help manage and automate the deployment of 
        containerized applications in a scalable and reliable manner
     **Terraform:**
      * An infrastructure as code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure resources, which can be 
        integrated into CD pipelines for managing cloud resources
    * **AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, and Google Cloud Build:**
      * Cloud providers offer their own CI/CD services and tools that integrate seamlessly with their ecosystems
  * **Version Control and Collaboration Tools:**
    * **Git:**
      * The most widely used distributed version control system, essential for managing source code
    * **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:**
      * These platforms provide version control, code hosting, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration, making them 
        central to modern software development
  * **Testing and Quality Assurance Tools:**
    * **JUnit, TestNG, and other testing frameworks:**
      * These are used for writing and running automated tests in various programming languages
    * **Selenium:**
      * A popular tool for automated testing of web applications
    * **SonarQube:**
      * An open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality
  * These are just a few examples of the many CI/CD tools and technologies available
  * The choice of tools and technologies will depend on your project's specific requirements, your team's expertise, 
    and the platforms you are targeting
  * Many organizations also build custom CI/CD pipelines using a combination of these tools to suit their unique needs
