# Design & Analysis of Algorithms - Chapter 1 Introduction Notes:

### Introduction:
* Quote:
  * Two ideas lie gleaming on the jeweler's velvet. The first is the calculus, the second, the algorithm
  * The calculus and the rich body of mathematical analysis to which it gave rise made moddern science possible;
  * But it has been the algorithm that has made possible the modern world.
  * - David Berlinski
* Why do you need to study algorithms?
  * If you are going to be a computer professional, there are both practical and theoretical reasons to study algorithms
    * From a practical standpoint, you have to know a standard set of important algorithms from different areas of computing;
      * In addition, tou should be able to design new algorithms and analyze their efficiency
