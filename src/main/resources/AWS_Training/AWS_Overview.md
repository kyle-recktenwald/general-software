# AWS Overview:

### AWS Eventbridge:
* **AWS EventBridge** is a **serverless event bus service** provided by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
* It enables you to **create event-driven architectures** by **simplifying the process** of **routing**, **processing**, 
  and **reacting to events across your AWS resources and SaaS (Software as a Service) applications**
* **Key features** of AWS EventBridge include:
  * **Event Bus:**
    * EventBridge provides a **centralized event bus** that acts as a **communication channel** for **sending and 
      receiving events**
    * You can **create custom event buses** to **organize events within your AWS account** or use **default event 
      buses** provided by **AWS services**
  * **Event Sources:**
    * EventBridge supports a **wide range of event sources**, including **AWS services**, **custom applications**, and 
      **third-party SaaS applications**
    * These **event sources generate events** that **can be routed to EventBridge** for **processing and analysis**
  * **Event Rules:**
    * With EventBridge, you can **create rules** to define **which events** should **trigger specific actions or 
      targets**
    * You can **filter events based on their attributes** and **route them to targets** such as **AWS Lambda 
      functions**, **Amazon SNS topics**, **Amazon SQS queues**, **AWS Step Functions state machines**, and more
  * **Schema Registry:**
    * EventBridge includes a **schema registry** that allows you to **define and manage** the **structure of events 
      produced by your applications**
    * By **enforcing event schemas**, you can **ensure consistency and compatibility** when **integrating different 
      systems and services**
  * **Integration with AWS Services:**
    * EventBridge **seamlessly integrates** with **various AWS services**, allowing you to **automate workflows** and 
      **respond to events in real-time**
    * For example, you can use EventBridge to **trigger AWS Lambda functions in response to events generated by Amazon 
      S3**, **Amazon DynamoDB**, **AWS CloudTrail**, **AWS CodePipeline**, and **other AWS services**
  * **Partner Integrations:**
    * EventBridge also **supports integrations** with **select third-party SaaS applications** through **partner 
      integrations**
    * This allows you to **consume events from external sources** and **automate workflows across different systems and 
      services**
* Overall, AWS EventBridge **simplifies the development** of **event-driven architectures** by providing a **scalable** 
  and **flexible event bus service** that enables **seamless communication** and **coordination between different 
  components of your applications and infrastructure**
