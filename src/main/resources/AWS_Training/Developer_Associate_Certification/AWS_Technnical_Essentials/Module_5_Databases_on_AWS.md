# Databases on AWS:

### Introduction to Databases on AWS:
* History Behind Enterprise Databases:
  * Choosing a database used to be a straightforward decision
  * Customers had only a few options to choose from
  * Typically, they would consider a few vendors and then, inevitably, choose one for all their applications
  * Businesses often selected a database technology before they fully understood their use case
  * Since the 1970s, the database type most commonly selected by businesses was a relational database
* Relational Databases:
  * A relational database organizes data into tables
  * Data in one table can link to data in other tables to create relationshipsâ€”hence, the relational part of the name
  * A table stores data in rows and columns
  * A row, often called a record, contains all information about a specific entry
  * Columns describe attributes of an entry
  * The following image is an example of three tables in a relational database
