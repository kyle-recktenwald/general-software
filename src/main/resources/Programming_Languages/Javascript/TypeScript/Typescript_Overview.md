# TypeScript Overview:

### Overview:
* TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft
* It's essentially JavaScript with additional features that enable developers to write more robust and manageable code
* TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which means it allows you to define variable types, function parameters, 
  and return types
* This helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support for code editors, enhancing the
  overall developer experience
* Ultimately, TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all JavaScript runtimes
  and environments
