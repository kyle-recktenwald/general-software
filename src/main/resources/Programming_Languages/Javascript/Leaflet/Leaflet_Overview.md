# Leaflet Overview:

### Overview:
* Leaflet is an **open-source JavaScript library** used for creating interactive maps on the web
* It's designed to be lightweight, simple to use, and highly customizable
* Developers use Leaflet to embed maps into web pages and build interactive mapping applications
* Key features of Leaflet include:
  * Map Display:
    * Leaflet allows you to display maps with various tile layers (such as OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, or custom tiles) 
      and zoom levels
  * Markers and Popups:
    * It enables the addition of markers to specific locations on the map and the creation of popups to display 
      additional information when markers are clicked
  * Layers and Overlays:
    * You can add multiple layers to maps, including tile layers, GeoJSON data, WMS layers, etc., and control their 
      visibility
  * Interactivity:
    * Leaflet supports user interactions like panning, zooming, dragging, and clicking on map elements
  * Plugins:
    * It has an extensive ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, providing features such as routing, 
      geocoding, clustering, and more
* Leaflet is widely used in web applications where mapping functionality is needed, such as in displaying 
  location-based data, creating custom maps, building GIS (Geographic Information System) applications, and 
  integrating maps into websites or web-based services
* It's known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice among developers for implementing maps in 
  web projects

### Leaflet-Geoman:
* Leaflet-Geoman is a plugin for the Leaflet JavaScript library that provides various drawing and editing
  functionalities for geographic objects on maps
* It extends Leaflet's capabilities by allowing users to draw shapes like polygons, circles, rectangles, markers, 
  and lines directly onto the map
* Additionally, it enables editing these shapes by resizing, moving, deleting, and altering their properties
* Geoman simplifies the process of creating interactive maps by offering a user-friendly interface for drawing and 
  manipulating geographic elements
* It's commonly used in web mapping applications that require functionalities such as drawing boundaries, marking 
  specific locations, or creating custom overlays on maps
* This plugin streamlines the development of such applications by providing a set of tools and interactions for 
  working with geographic data within Leaflet-based maps
