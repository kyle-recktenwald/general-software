# Node.js Overview:

### Overview:
* Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
* It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server, outside of a web browser
* Node.js enables the development of scalable and high-performance applications by leveraging an event-driven, 
  non-blocking I/O model
* One of the key features of Node.js is its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections with high 
  throughput, making it well-suited for building real-time applications like chat applications, streaming services, 
  and APIs
* It utilizes a single-threaded, event-driven architecture, which allows for asynchronous processing, enabling
  developers to create efficient, responsive applications
* Node.js also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager), which 
  greatly enhances its functionality and allows developers to build applications more quickly by utilizing existing
  modules
* It's widely used in web development for creating web servers, RESTful APIs, and backend services
