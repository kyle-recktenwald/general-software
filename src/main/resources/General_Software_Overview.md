# General Software Overview:

## Big O:

### Overview:
* Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms

### Open Source:
* "**Open source**" in software refers to the practice of making the **source code** of a **software project freely 
  available to the public**
* It allows **anyone** to **view**, **modify**, and **distribute the code without significant restrictions**
* This approach **fosters collaboration**, **transparency**, and **community-driven development**
* Key characteristics of open source software include:
  * **Access to Source Code:**
    * The **source code** of the software is **accessible to anyone**
    * This **transparency** allows developers to **study**, **modify**, and **enhance the software**
  * **Freedom to Modify and Redistribute:**
    * **Open source licenses typically grant users** the **freedom to modify the software** and **distribute their 
      modifications**
    * This **encourages innovation and collaboration** among developers
  * **Community-Driven Development:**
    * Open source projects often have **communities of contributors** who **collaborate on improving the software**
    * These communities can include **developers**, **users**, and **organizations**
  * **Licensing:**
    * Open source software is **usually released under licenses** approved by the **Open Source Initiative** (**OSI**)
    * These licenses **outline** the **terms and conditions** for **using**, **modifying**, and **distributing** the 
      software
* Examples of popular open source software include the **Linux operating system**, the **Apache HTTP Server**, the 
  **Mozilla Firefox web browser**, and the **WordPress content management system**
* The open source movement has had a **significant impact on the software industry**, **promoting innovation**, **fostering the 
  creation** of **high-quality software**, and providing **cost-effective solutions** for **individuals**, 
  **businesses**, and **organizations**
* Additionally, it **encourages a culture** of **sharing knowledge and code** for the **betterment of technology as a 
  whole**
