# General Software Overview:

## Big O:

### Overview:
* Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms

### Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts:
* **Data Structures:**
  * **Linear:**
    * Linked Lists
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Vectors/ArrayLists
  * **Graphs:**
    * Graphs
    * Trees
    * Tries
    * Heaps
  * **Associative:**
    * Hash Tables
* **Algorithms:**
  * Breadth-First Search
  * Depth-First Search
