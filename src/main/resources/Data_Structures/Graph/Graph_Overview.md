# Graph Overview:

### Overview:
* A **graph** is a **data structure** used in computer science and mathematics to represent a **collection of objects** 
  and the **relationships between them**
* A graph consists of two main components:
  * **Node (Vertex):**
    * A **node**, often referred to as a **vertex**, is a **fundamental element** of a graph
    * Nodes can **represent various entities**, such as **data points, objects, or elements** in a **system**
    * **Each node** typically has a **unique identifier** or **label** to distinguish it from other nodes in the graph
  * **Edge:**
    * An **edge** is a **connection or link** between two nodes in the graph
    * Edges can be **directional (directed graph)** or **non-directional (undirected graph)**
      * In a **directed graph**, the **edges have a specific direction**, indicating a **one-way relationship** from one 
        node to another, while in an **undirected graph**, the **edges have no direction** and represent a 
        **symmetric relationship**
    * Edges can be **weighted** or **unweighted**
      * In a **weighted graph**, **each edge** has a **numerical value associated with it**, representing some **measure 
        of the relationship or cost between the connected nodes**

* Graphs can take many forms and have various use cases, including:
  * **Social networks**, where **nodes** represent **individuals**, and **edges** represent friendships or 
    **connections** between them
  * **Transportation networks**, where **nodes** are **locations** (e.g., cities) and edges represent **roads or 
    routes** connecting them
  * **Dependency graphs** in software, where **nodes** represent **components or modules**, and **edges** represent 
    **dependencies** between them
  * **Knowledge graphs**, where **nodes** are **concepts** or entities, and **edges** represent **semantic relationships** 
    or connections between them
* Graphs can be classified into different types, such as directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs, and 
  more, based on the specific characteristics of their nodes and edges
* They are widely used in computer science and various applications, including **data modeling**, **network analysis**, 
  and **algorithm design**
